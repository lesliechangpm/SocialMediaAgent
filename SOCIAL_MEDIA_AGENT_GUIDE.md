Market Analysis: 30-Year Fixed Rates at 6.95%

After three decades in mortgage lending, I've observed that current market conditions present unique opportunities for pre-retirees and retirees. This week's rate decrease of 0.15% reflects broader economic stabilization and provides several strategic advantages:

‚Ä¢ Refinancing opportunities for loans above 7.5%
‚Ä¢ Reverse mortgage applications at more favorable terms  
‚Ä¢ Debt consolidation strategies for simplified retirement planning

For those approaching or in retirement, mortgage decisions require careful analysis of your complete financial picture. I provide the thorough, personalized guidance you deserve - taking time to understand your unique situation and long-term goals.

With economic uncertainty, having an experienced mortgage professional who prioritizes your financial security has never been more valuable.
